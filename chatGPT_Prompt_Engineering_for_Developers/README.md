This repository contains the materials for the course "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" offered by DeepLearning.AI and taught by Isa Fulford from OpenAI and Andrew Ng. In this course, you will learn how to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs) to build powerful and innovative applications. By leveraging the OpenAI API, you can unlock new possibilities and create value in ways that were previously challenging, highly technical, or even deemed impossible.

## Course Description
ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers introduces you to the world of LLMs and equips you with the knowledge and skills needed to make the most out of them. You will gain insights into how LLMs work, learn best practices for prompt engineering, and discover the wide range of tasks LLM APIs can handle. Some of the key areas covered in this course include:

- **Summarizing**: Condensing lengthy texts (e.g., user reviews) for brevity.
- **Inferring**: Classifying sentiment and extracting topics from text.
- **Transforming text**: Performing tasks such as translation, spelling, and grammar correction.
- **Expanding**: Automatically generating text, such as writing emails.

Throughout the course, you will also learn two fundamental principles for crafting effective prompts, acquire techniques to systematically engineer optimal prompts, and build a custom chatbot. The concepts are reinforced through numerous examples, and you'll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience by working directly with Jupyter notebooks in our interactive environment.
